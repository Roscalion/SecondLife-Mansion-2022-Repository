// SECONDLIFE MASNION -- JAVASCRIPT //

TERP LORE: SecondLife is a metaverse where ROSCA and JINX frequented after WAR 83 in Callahan. After using 
his money from helping JINX win, ROSCA would help use it to help with research for SecondLife Real Estate. 

So ROSCA would be seen coding a plan for them to have mansions in SecondLife after they were able to get back 
there again.
